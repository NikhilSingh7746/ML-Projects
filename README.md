What is Machine Learning? <br>
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions.

🧠 How It Works
ML models learn by:

Inputting data (structured or unstructured).

Extracting patterns or relationships.

Training on these patterns using statistical methods.

Predicting or classifying new/unseen data.

Improving performance over time as more data is exposed (retraining or online learning).

🔍 Types of Machine Learning
Supervised Learning

Data is labeled (e.g. spam vs not spam).

Algorithms learn mapping from input to output.

Common tasks: Classification, Regression.

Unsupervised Learning

Data is unlabeled.

The model finds hidden patterns or groups.

Common tasks: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Association.

Semi-supervised Learning

Mix of labeled and unlabeled data.

Useful when labeling is expensive.

Reinforcement Learning

Agents learn by interacting with environments.

Rewards and punishments guide learning.

Used in robotics, games, self-driving cars.

⚙️ Common Steps in an ML Project
Data Collection – Gathering raw data from various sources.

Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding data using statistics and visuals.

Feature Engineering – Creating or transforming input features.

Model Selection & Training – Choosing algorithms and fitting them to data.

Model Evaluation – Measuring performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.

Model Tuning – Improving performance via hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation.

Deployment – Making the model usable in production (e.g., APIs or dashboards).

🛠️ Popular Libraries & Tools
Scikit-learn – Classical ML algorithms and model evaluation.

Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy – Numerical computing.

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding and documentation.

(Others: XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, PyTorch – for advanced ML and DL tasks)

💼 Why Machine Learning Matters
ML enables automation, personalization, and intelligence across industries:

Healthcare – Disease prediction, medical image analysis.

Finance – Fraud detection, credit scoring.

E-commerce – Recommendation engines, customer segmentation.

Marketing – Targeted ads, customer churn prediction.
