# Machine Learning Projects Overview

## 📌 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It improves over time as it is exposed to more data.

## 🧠 How It Works

ML systems:
1. Take input data.
2. Identify patterns or relationships.
3. Train using statistical methods.
4. Make predictions on new data.
5. Improve performance through feedback and retraining.

## 🔍 Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning** – Trained on labeled data (e.g., spam detection, price prediction).
- **Unsupervised Learning** – Works with unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Semi-supervised Learning** – Mix of labeled and unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Agents learn by interacting with the environment (e.g., self-driving cars, game playing).

## ⚙️ Typical ML Workflow

1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Engineering  
5. Model Selection and Training  
6. Evaluation (Accuracy, RMSE, etc.)  
7. Hyperparameter Tuning  
8. Deployment (API, web app, dashboard)

## 🛠️ Common Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` – Classical ML models and metrics
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
- `Jupyter Notebook` – Interactive development

## 💼 Applications of ML

- **Healthcare** – Disease prediction, medical imaging
- **Finance** – Fraud detection, credit scoring
- **Retail** – Recommendation systems, demand forecasting
- **Marketing** – Customer segmentation, ad targeting
